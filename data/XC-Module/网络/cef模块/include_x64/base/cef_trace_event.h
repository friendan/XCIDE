/// \file
/// Trace events are for tracking application performance and resource usage.
/// Macros are provided to track:
///    Begin and end of function calls
///    Counters
///
/// Events are issued against categories. Whereas LOG's categories are
/// statically defined, TRACE categories are created implicitly with a string.
/// For example: <pre>
///   TRACE_EVENT_INSTANT0("MY_SUBSYSTEM", "SomeImportantEvent")
/// </pre>
///
/// Events can be INSTANT, or can be pairs of BEGIN and END in the same scope:
/// <pre>
///   TRACE_EVENT_BEGIN0("MY_SUBSYSTEM", "SomethingCostly")
///   doSomethingCostly()
///   TRACE_EVENT_END0("MY_SUBSYSTEM", "SomethingCostly")
/// </pre>
/// Note: Our tools can't always determine the correct BEGIN/END pairs unless
/// these are used in the same scope. Use ASYNC_BEGIN/ASYNC_END macros if you
/// need them to be in separate scopes.
///
/// A common use case is to trace entire function scopes. This issues a trace
/// BEGIN and END automatically:
/// <pre>
///   void doSomethingCostly() {
///     TRACE_EVENT0("MY_SUBSYSTEM", "doSomethingCostly");
///     ...
///   }
/// </pre>
///
/// Additional parameters can be associated with an event:
/// <pre>
///   void doSomethingCostly2(int howMuch) {
///     TRACE_EVENT1("MY_SUBSYSTEM", "doSomethingCostly",
///         "howMuch", howMuch);
///     ...
///   }
/// </pre>
///
/// The trace system will automatically add to this information the current
/// process id, thread id, and a timestamp in microseconds.
///
/// To trace an asynchronous procedure such as an IPC send/receive, use
/// ASYNC_BEGIN and ASYNC_END:
/// <pre>
///   [single threaded sender code]
///     static int send_count = 0;
///     ++send_count;
///     TRACE_EVENT_ASYNC_BEGIN0("ipc", "message", send_count);
///     Send(new MyMessage(send_count));
///   [receive code]
///     void OnMyMessage(send_count) {
///       TRACE_EVENT_ASYNC_END0("ipc", "message", send_count);
///     }
/// </pre>
/// The third parameter is a unique ID to match ASYNC_BEGIN/ASYNC_END pairs.
/// ASYNC_BEGIN and ASYNC_END can occur on any thread of any traced process.
/// Pointers can be used for the ID parameter, and they will be mangled
/// internally so that the same pointer on two different processes will not
/// match. For example:
/// <pre>
///   class MyTracedClass {
///    public:
///     MyTracedClass() {
///       TRACE_EVENT_ASYNC_BEGIN0("category", "MyTracedClass", this);
///     }
///     ~MyTracedClass() {
///       TRACE_EVENT_ASYNC_END0("category", "MyTracedClass", this);
///     }
///   }
/// </pre>
///
/// The trace event also supports counters, which is a way to track a quantity
/// as it varies over time. Counters are created with the following macro:
/// <pre>
///   TRACE_COUNTER1("MY_SUBSYSTEM", "myCounter", g_myCounterValue);
/// </pre>
///
/// Counters are process-specific. The macro itself can be issued from any
/// thread, however.
///
/// Sometimes, you want to track two counters at once. You can do this with two
/// counter macros:
/// <pre>
///   TRACE_COUNTER1("MY_SUBSYSTEM", "myCounter0", g_myCounterValue[0]);
///   TRACE_COUNTER1("MY_SUBSYSTEM", "myCounter1", g_myCounterValue[1]);
/// </pre>
/// Or you can do it with a combined macro:
/// <pre>
///   TRACE_COUNTER2("MY_SUBSYSTEM", "myCounter",
///       "bytesPinned", g_myCounterValue[0],
///       "bytesAllocated", g_myCounterValue[1]);
/// </pre>
/// This indicates to the tracing UI that these counters should be displayed
/// in a single graph, as a summed area chart.
///
/// Since counters are in a global namespace, you may want to disembiguate with
/// a unique ID, by using the TRACE_COUNTER_ID* variations.
///
/// By default, trace collection is compiled in, but turned off at runtime.
/// Collecting trace data is the responsibility of the embedding application. In
/// CEF's case, calling BeginTracing will turn on tracing on all active
/// processes.
///
///
/// Memory scoping note:
/// Tracing copies the pointers, not the string content, of the strings passed
/// in for category, name, and arg_names.  Thus, the following code will cause
/// problems:
/// <pre>
///     char* str = strdup("impprtantName");
///     TRACE_EVENT_INSTANT0("SUBSYSTEM", str);  // BAD!
///     free(str);                   // Trace system now has dangling pointer
/// </pre>
///
///
/// Thread Safety:
/// All macros are thread safe and can be used from any process.
